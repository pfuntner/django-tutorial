This is the tutorial's project, originally created by `django-admin startproject mysite`.

I'll keep track of the steps here:

| Step # | Step | Status | Comments |
| ---: | --- | :---: | --- |
| [1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/#creating-a-project) | Create new project with `django-tutorial` | ✔️ | At first, I tryed it in my `django-tutorial` directory but I need to be in `django-tutorial/mysite` |
| [2](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/#creating-a-project) | Start the server | ✔️ |  |
